## Siddharth Narigra

Final-year Computer Engineering student focused on **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**.  
I build **data-driven systems**, **real-time detection pipelines**, and **explainable ML workflows** using Python.

### What I work on
- Real-time computer vision systems (YOLOv5, OpenCV, CPU-optimized pipelines)
- End-to-end ML workflows: data cleaning, training, evaluation, deployment
- Explainable ML and automation using multi-agent systems
- Practical engineering with real datasets and measurable performance
