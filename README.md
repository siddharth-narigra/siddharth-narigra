## Siddharth Narigra

Python developer focused on building practical data automation and analysis tools.

I work on projects that handle messy real-world data, automate analysis workflows, and produce clear, usable outputs. I also have hands-on experience with applied machine learning, but my focus is on building things that actually work end-to-end.

### What I work on
- Python-based data automation and reporting tools
- Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and workflow automation
- Building simple user-facing tools (scripts, apps, dashboards)
- Applied machine learning with an emphasis on evaluation and explainability
